Hundreds of free advertisements for vehicles are published on our site every day. The purpose of this analysis is to study which factors influence the price of a vehicle.

We would begin by loading the data and exploring it. This would be to check if we have any descrepancies with the data in terms of missing values, duplicates as well as data types that have been stored incorrectly. If we find any of these, we would clean up the data and correct them.

We would then proceed to study the core parameters that we feel would impact the price of a vehicle and determine which of those affects the price.
